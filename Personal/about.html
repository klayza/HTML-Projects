        <h4>Interests</h4>
        <p>
            I have been using computers since I was 14 years old and ever since then I have become unhealthily attached to everything related such as software programming, cybersecurity, and penetration testing. Most people call these jobs but for me, it's an unhealthy addiction. <br><br>
            Another interest I have is journaling. I love reflecting on my experiences because it’s the only way to acknowledge that I might stand out among society. Keeping thoughts and emotions stored on a drive can be therapeutic if you ever need to look back and see how far you've come. <br><br>
            As for clubs or sports, I perform in the marching band and play the mellophone. Marching band is a very overwhelming activity to play in, because you have to remember where to move, what notes to play, and to keep your posture in position. It's a lot of effort but in retrospect, it’s worth it in the end, seeing how far we’ve come in the 4 months of non-stop practicing. <br><br>
            For my job I work at a pizza place, and make sandwiches, salads, and sides. Sometimes pizzas, but I prefer making sandwiches.

        <h4>Skills</h4>
        <p>
            Some of my skills are scuba diving, computer understanding, cooking, patience, and reasoning. Those are the main ones but I’d say that I am most adept at computers because I use them everyday. <br><br>
            I have my advanced scuba certification which means I have the ability to dive to 36 meters, but I enjoy scuba diving a lot because like all divers will say, it’s like another world under the water. Very calm, sometimes freezing cold, and you get to be up close with coral, fish, turtles, and one time I even saw a reef shark when I was in Maui. <br><br>
            I like to cook every so often, mostly oriental food, but I feel accomplished seeing people like the food I make. <br><br>
            I am a pretty patient guy, when I know whatever I am waiting for is out of my control, but if it is within my control and I know I am losing time, I get anxious. Reasoning is another skill I have that some people don’t have. People seem to let their emotions get the best of them, I’ve learnt that from personal experience, and it is impossible to logically reason with someone like that, believe me, I’ve tried. <br><br>
            Besides that, some of my skills that I need to work on are being nicer to my siblings, and to stop procrastinating. I can’t connect to my siblings, because I have to deal with them everyday, I have to clean up after them and remind them to do their chores, and they haven’t shown any forms of change so it might stay this way for a while. All of the scrolling on social media is getting tiring, but I find myself doing that for hours a day. It’s a problem that the previous generation wasn’t faced with, but now it’s here for us to fix.

        <h4>Academics</h4>
        <p>
            I usually settle with B’s and A’s because it’s around average and I would rather put my time into stuff other than school. But this year, I have maintained all A’s. I don’t know where the sudden increase of effort came from, but I am regretting not trying the years before and settling with mediocrity. I might’ve missed out on a few scholarships for not trying, but I’m not going to acknowledge my regrets. <br><br>
            Out of all my classes, my favorite is math because I am also getting experience with some computer programming fundamentals. My least favorite is English because I’m usually forced to write about something I don’t like, and we are told to use some writing technique that is really strange and uncomfortable. But by myself, I believe I am a good creative writer when I am passionate about the subject.
